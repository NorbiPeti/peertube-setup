For video storage I am using a [Hetzner storage box](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box). The RAM and disk space are more than enough, but faster CPU would always be better to speed up transcoding. Outgoing traffic is roughly 1 TB per month. Total cost is about 23 â‚¬ per month (including backups and domain renewal). The instance config (with Ansible and docker-compose) is [available here](https://yerbamate.dev/nutomic/peertube-compose).\n",
